## Briefly about me
Currently i am a second year student of Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics. Recently i have realised that i'm not interested in subjects that we learn in the university, so i decided to embark on the Rolling Scopes course (JS/Frontend-development). Also i'm a huge fun of visual effects, so from my point of view this direction will fit me properly.

As for my strong qualities:
* I am fond of being a team member,i really like  interacting with my colleagues during work.
* If i have a goal i'll undoubtedly reach it, cause i've been taught to be single-minded and not to give up.
* I am eager to learn new information in the field since it's pretty important for me to be better than i was yesterday.

## Qualifications and skills:
* Basic C++.
* Sony Vegas Pro on a amateur level.
* CSS and HTML.
* JS (learning).
